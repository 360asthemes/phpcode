In PHP 8.2.0 have a new function mysqli_execute_query or mysqli::execute_query. It is a really nice feature. you can do following things with one function

generate a prepared statement
execute it by substituting values from the array of variables
retrieve query result as associative array

<?php
$query = 'SELECT Title, Date FROM Book WHERE Title Like ? ORDER BY Title';

/* here the magic */
$result = $mysqli->execute_query($query, ['hobbit']);

foreach ($result as $row) {
    printf("Title: %s \n", $row["Title"]);
    printf("Purchase Date: %s \n", $row["Date"]);
     
}
?>
